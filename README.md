Haps.at
=======

Overview
--------
Haps.at is just an example Tornado web site, utilizing several 
really basic implementations of asynchronous API libraries.

It depends on tornado (http://github.com/facebook/tornado) and
torn (http://github.com/joshmarshall/torn)

You can start it with python start.py in the main directory, but
until you set the API keys in a settings_local.py (or haps/settings.py)
it won't actually do much.

Platforms used (i.e. keys needed):
* Twitter
* Flickr
* Last.FM
* Yelp
